# Introduction
The library python-visualize is a collection of python functions to create 2D graphics in Python.  As it stands, the library does not provide a uniform API nor does it contain optimized functions.  Both of those will, hopefully come, assuming that development continues of the code contained herein.  Then again, this is very much a "silly" project that is, in many ways, just the results of asking the question "what if."  Maybe it will be expanded, maybe it won't.

# Dependencies
As it stands, python-visualize depends upon Numpy, PIL, matplotlib, MoviePy, and blend-modes.
